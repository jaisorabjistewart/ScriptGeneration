    "In choosing my n_layers I consulted [this lesson fron the Stanford CS231 course](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/), where it says \"...in practice it is often the case that 3-layer neural networks will outperform 2-layer nets, but going even deeper (4,5,6-layer) rarely helps much more.\" Therefore I performed many attempts at training, testing both of these depths. Surprisingly, I couldn't get blow loss ~ 3.8 with a 3-layer network so I reduced to 2 layers and was able to reduce my loss. Perhaps the extra layer was leading to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also tried different learning rates, but found that increases even as small as lr = 0.005 prevented any further reduction of loss beyond ~ 4.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sequence_length I tried a few runs with sequence_length=10 and also sequence_length=30, but neither of these produced great results. The larger length of 30 would likely have caused problems for my model since it's significantly harder to generate sentences ~30 words long than ~20. Maybe the larger length would have helped if I had the resources to run the training process for many more epochs though. I'm unsure as to why using a shorter sequence length didn't improve my training loss though.\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially thought that a larger embedding dimension would be more helpful in learning to generate scripts since in general more nodes allows a model to learn deeper connections between more words, but using embedding_dim=400 was making it difficult to get a loss below 4. Perhaps the vocabulary of Seinfeld scripts is fairly basic and so 400 was overkill for the job and led to unnecessary/irrelevant patterns being learnt. I did some research and found that 50-300 is a standard range for embedding_dim, so I tested a few values in this range and found 300 to work well. Likewise, for the hidden dimension I experimented with a few values, starting off too high at first but settling on 256.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the most significant improvement to my model came from removing dropout. Research on the Udacity Q&A platform taught me that for a dataset this small and with so few layers to our model, dropout has a chance of causing underfitting and halting the reduction of my loss. I attempted training with dropout=0 and with the self.dropout layer commented out, and was at last able to get my loss below 3.5.\n"
